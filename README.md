# Diabetes-Prediction

**Diabetes** is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose. Blood glucose is the primary energy source derived from the nutrients you consume. The pancreas produces a hormone known as insulin, which assists in facilitating the transfer of glucose from ingested food into your cells for energy utilization. In certain cases, your body might not produce sufficient insulin, or it might struggle to effectively use the insulin produced. As a result, glucose remains in the bloodstream rather than being transported into the cells where it can be employed for energy purposes.

*Predicting diabetes* holds significant importance as it enables early identification and proactive management of the condition. Early detection allows individuals to make lifestyle adjustments, monitor their health more closely, and initiate appropriate medical interventions.

In this educational project for diabetes prediction, we will use and compare different Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Additionally, Ensemble Learning (Stacking Algorithm) will be implemented to increase accuracy prediction.
